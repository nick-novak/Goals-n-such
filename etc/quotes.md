As followers of the Middle Way, we would do well to remind ourselves that the future is likely to be played out somewhere between these two narratives.

At the same time, we still may be able to prevent the worst of it – for both humans and nonhuman species. That is to say, with a little luck and a lot of work, we might preserve humanity’s place in the cycle of samsara, with a new perspective on suffering and our relationship to this precious earth."
