HGTV's Dream Home 2016 Sweepstakes prize total this year is at $1.75 million. With federal taxes (roughly 25%), it would cost the winner $437,500 if they decided to keep it. Also since this year the house is located in Florida, it would be exempted from state taxes on sweepstakes winnings. Florida is 1 of 11 states that do not tax sweepstakes winners.

The legend of le Marche du Nain Rouge. A little red imp, who is the embodiment of ambition, anger, pride, envy. According to legend, the founder of Detroit Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac was warned of this creature. He laughed it off after hearing that it was the harbinger of doom. But after an encounter with the little red devil, he ran into misfortunes and returned to France where he died penniless. But Detroit thrived after he had left and every year is host to a large celebration of all that is good in the city of Detroit, of liberation from the Nain.
