HGTV's Dream Home 2016 Sweepstakes prize total this year is at $1.75 million. With federal taxes (roughly 25%), it would cost the winner $437,500 if they decided to keep it. Also since this year the house is located in Florida, it would be exempted from state taxes on sweepstakes winnings. Florida is 1 of 11 states that do not tax sweepstakes winners.

The legend of le Marche du Nain Rouge. A little red imp, who is the embodiment of ambition, anger, pride, envy. According to legend, the founder of Detroit Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac was warned of this creature. He laughed it off after hearing that it was the harbinger of doom. But after an encounter with the little red devil, he ran into misfortunes and returned to France where he died penniless. But Detroit thrived after he had left and every year is host to a large celebration of all that is good in the city of Detroit, of liberation from the Nain.

During the height of the spice trade, Europeans were making up tall tales about how to get these spices. People believed that mythical creatures guarded them and that you needed special skills to obtain them. This came about because the wealthy that were buying them didn't know much about the exotic lands from which the spices arrived. So traders would tell tall tales about them and concealed the truth. Either to add mystic to the spices or to drive up the prices.
