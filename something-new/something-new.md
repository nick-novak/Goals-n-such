HGTV's Dream Home 2016 Sweepstakes prize total this year is at $1.75 million. With federal taxes (roughly 25%), it would cost the winner $437,500 if they decided to keep it. Also since this year the house is located in Florida, it would be exempted from state taxes on sweepstakes winnings. Florida is 1 of 11 states that do not tax sweepstakes winners.
